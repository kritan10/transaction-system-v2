# Transaction v2

> This project is a work in progress

This project is a small prototype of a transaction system based on microservices | event-driven architecture.

## Key Design Features

- **Apache Kafka** for event-based communication
- **gRPC** for microservice stubs.
- Data persistence using **SQLite** (might change in the future).
- Asynchronous communication between microservices.

## Use Cases (and TODO)

- [x] User account creation and management
- [x] User transaction account creation and functionality of transaction between users
- [ ] Support for different types of transaction
- [ ] Support for redeem promo code on transaction
- [ ] Support for notification
